title: 'Toward Understanding Complex Spaces: Graph Laplacians on Manifolds with Singularities
  and Boundaries'
abstract: 'In manifold learning, algorithms based on graph Laplacian constructed from
  data have received considerable attention both in practical applications and theoretical
  analysis. Much of the existing work has been done under the assumption that the
  data is sampled from a manifold without boundaries and singularities or that the
  functions of interest are evaluated away from such points. At the same time, it
  can be argued that singularities and boundaries are an important aspect of the geometry
  of realistic data. Boundaries occur whenever the process generating data has a bounding
  constraint; while singularities appear when two different manifolds intersect or
  if a process undergoes a â€œphase transition", changing non-smoothly as a function
  of a parameter. In this paper we consider the behavior of graph Laplacians at points
  at or near boundaries and two main types of other singularities: \emphintersections,
  where different manifolds come together and sharp \emph"edges", where a manifold
  sharply changes direction. We show that the behavior of graph Laplacian near these
  singularities is quite different from that in the interior of the manifolds. In
  fact, a phenomenon somewhat reminiscent of the Gibbs effect in the analysis of Fourier
  series, can be observed in the behavior of graph Laplacian near such points. Unlike
  in the interior of the domain, where graph Laplacian converges to the Laplace-Beltrami
  operator, near singularities graph Laplacian tends to a first-order differential
  operator, which exhibits different scaling behavior as a function of the kernel
  width. One important implication is that while points near the singularities occupy
  only a small part of the total volume, the difference in scaling results in a disproportionately
  large contribution to the total behavior. Another significant finding is that while
  the scaling behavior of the operator is the same near different types of singularities,
  they are very distinct at a more refined level of analysis. We believe that a comprehensive
  understanding of these structures in addition to the standard case of a smooth manifold
  can take us a long way toward better methods for analysis of complex non-linear
  data and can lead to significant progress in algorithm design. Keywords: Graph Laplacian,
  singularities, limit analysis'
