title: Competitive Classification and Closeness Testing
abstract: We study the problems of \emph{classification} and \emph{closeness testing}.
  A \emph{classifier} associates a test sequence with the one of two training sequences
  that was generated by the same distribution. A \emph{closeness test} determines
  whether two sequences were generated by the same or by different distributions.
  For both problems all natural algorithms are \emph{symmetric} -- they make the same
  decision under all symbol relabelings. With no assumptions on the distributions'
  support size or relative distance, we construct a classifier and closeness test
  that require at most $O(n^{3/2})$ samples to attain the $n$-sample accuracy of the
  best symmetric classifier or closeness test designed with knowledge of the underlying
  distributions. Both algorithms run in time linear in the number of samples. Conversely
  we also show that for any classifier or closeness test, there are distributions
  that require $\Omega(n^{7/6})$ samples to achieve the $n$-sample accuracy of the
  best symmetric algorithm that knows the underlying distributions.
