title: 'Unsupervised SVMs: On the Complexity of the Furthest Hyperplane Problem'
abstract: This paper introduces the Furthest Hyperplane Problem (FHP), which is an
  unsupervised counterpart of Support Vector Machines. Given a set of n points in
  R^d, the objective is to produce the hyperplane (passing through the origin) which
  maximizes the separation margin, that is, the minimal distance between the hyperplane
  and any input point. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper achieving
  provable results regarding FHP. We provide both lower and upper bounds to this NP-hard
  problem. First, we give a simple randomized algorithm whose running time is n^O(1/θ^2)
  where θis the optimal separation margin. We show that its exponential dependency
  on 1/θ^2 is tight, up to sub-polynomial factors, assuming SAT cannot be solved in
  sub-exponential time. Next, we give an efficient approximation algorithm. For any
  α∈[0, 1], the algorithm produces a hyperplane whose distance from at least 1 - 3αfraction
  of the points is at least αtimes the optimal separation margin. Finally, we show
  that FHP does not admit a PTAS by presenting a gap preserving reduction from a particular
  version of the PCP theorem.
