title: Competitive Classification and Closeness Testing
abstract: We study the problems of \emphclassification and \emphcloseness testing.
  A \emphclassifier associates a test sequence with the one of two training sequences
  that was generated by the same distribution. A \emphcloseness test determines whether
  two sequences were generated by the same or by different distributions. For both
  problems all natural algorithms are \emphsymmetric – they make the same decision
  under all symbol relabelings. With no assumptions on the distributions’ support
  size or relative distance, we construct a classifier and closeness test that require
  at most O(n^3/2) samples to attain the n-sample accuracy of the best symmetric classifier
  or closeness test designed with knowledge of the underlying distributions. Both
  algorithms run in time linear in the number of samples. Conversely we also show
  that for any classifier or closeness test, there are distributions that require
  Ω(n^7/6) samples to achieve the n-sample accuracy of the best symmetric algorithm
  that knows the underlying distributions.
