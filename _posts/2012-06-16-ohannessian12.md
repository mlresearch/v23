title: Rare Probability Estimation under Regularly Varying Heavy Tails
abstract: This paper studies the problem of estimating the probability of symbols
  that have occurred very rarely, in samples drawn independently from an unknown,
  possibly infinite, discrete distribution. In particular, we study the multiplicative
  consistency of estimators, defined as the ratio of the estimate to the true quantity
  converging to one. We first show that the classical Good-Turing estimator is not
  universally consistent in this sense, despite enjoying favorable additive properties.
  We then use Karamataâ€™s theory of regular variation to prove that regularly varying
  heavy tails are sufficient for consistency. At the core of this result is a multiplicative
  concentration that we establish both by extending the McAllester-Ortiz additive
  concentration for the missing mass to all rare probabilities and by exploiting regular
  variation. We also derive a family of estimators which, in addition to being consistent,
  address some of the shortcomings of the Good-Turing estimator. For example, they
  perform smoothing implicitly and have the absolute discounting structure of many
  heuristic algorithms. This also establishes a discrete parallel to extreme value
  theory, and many of the techniques therein can be adapted to the framework that
  we set forth.
