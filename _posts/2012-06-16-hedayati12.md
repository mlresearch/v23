title: The Optimality of Jeffreys Prior for Online Density Estimation and the Asymptotic
  Normality of Maximum Likelihood Estimators
abstract: We study online learning under logarithmic loss with regular parametric
  models. We show that a Bayesian strategy predicts optimally only if it uses Jeffreys
  prior. This result was known for canonical exponential families; we extend it to
  parametric models for which the maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically normal.
  The optimal prediction strategy, normalized maximum likelihood, depends on the number
  \emph{n} of rounds of the game, in general. However, when a Bayesian strategy is
  optimal, normalized maximum likelihood becomes independent of \emph{n}. Our proof
  uses this to exploit the asymptotics of normalized maximum likelihood. The asymptotic
  normality of the maximum likelihood estimator is responsible for the necessity of
  Jeffreys prior.
