title: Computational Bounds on Statistical Query Learning
abstract: 'We study the complexity of learning in Kearns’ well-known \emphstatistical
  query (SQ) learning model (Kearns, 1993). A number of previous works have addressed
  the definition and estimation of the information-theoretic bounds on the SQ learning
  complexity, in other words, bounds on the query complexity. Here we give the first
  strictly computational upper and lower bounds on the complexity of several types
  of learning in the SQ model. As it was already observed, the known characterization
  of distribution-specific SQ learning (Blum, et al. 1994) implies that for weak learning
  over a fixed distribution, the query complexity and computational complexity are
  essentially the same. In contrast, we show that for both distribution-specific and
  distribution-independent (strong) learning there exists a concept class of polynomial
  query complexity that is not efficiently learnable unless RP = NP. We then prove
  that our distribution-specific lower bound is essentially tight by showing that
  for every concept class \emphC of polynomial query complexity there exists a polynomial
  time algorithm that given access to random points from any distribution \emphD and
  an NP oracle, can SQ learn \emphC over \emphD. We also consider a restriction of
  the SQ model, the correlational statistical query (CSQ) model (Bshouty and Feldman,
  2001; Feldman, 2008) of learning which is closely-related to Valiant’s model of
  evolvability (Valiant, 2007). We show a similar separation result for distribution-independent
  CSQ learning under a stronger assumption: there exists a concept class of polynomial
  CSQ query complexity which is not efficiently learnable unless every problem in
  W[P] has a randomized fixed parameter tractable algorithm.'
