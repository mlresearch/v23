title: Consistency of Nearest Neighbor Classification under Selective Sampling
abstract: This paper studies nearest neighbor classification in a model where unlabeled
  data points arrive in a stream, and the learner decides, for each one, whether to
  ask for its label. Are there generic ways to augment or modify any selective sampling
  strategy so as to ensure the consistency of the resulting nearest neighbor classifier?
