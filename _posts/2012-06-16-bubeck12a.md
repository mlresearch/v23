title: Towards Minimax Policies for Online Linear Optimization with Bandit Feedback
abstract: 'We address the online linear optimization problem with bandit feedback.
  Our contribution is twofold. First, we provide an algorithm (based on exponential
  weights) with a regret of order √\emphdn log \emphN for any finite action set with
  \emphN actions, under the assumption that the instantaneous loss is bounded by 1.
  This shaves off an extraneous √\emphd factor compared to previous works, and gives
  a regret bound of order \emphd√\emphn log \emphn for any compact set of actions.
  Without further assumptions on the action set, this last bound is minimax optimal
  up to a logarithmic factor. Interestingly, our result also shows that the minimax
  regret for bandit linear optimization with expert advice in \emphd dimension is
  the same as for the basic \emphd-armed bandit with expert advice. Our second contribution
  is to show how to use the Mirror Descent algorithm to obtain computationally efficient
  strategies with minimax optimal regret bounds in specific examples. More precisely
  we study two canonical action sets: the hypercube and the Euclidean ball. In the
  former case, we obtain the first computationally efficient algorithm with a \emphd√\emphn
  regret, thus improving by a factor √\emphd log \emphn over the best known result
  for a computationally efficient algorithm. In the latter case, our approach gives
  the first algorithm with a √\emphdn log \emphn, again shaving off an extraneous
  √\emphd compared to previous works.'
