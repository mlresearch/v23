title: PAC-Bayesian Bound for Gaussian Process Regression and Multiple Kernel Additive
  Model
abstract: We develop a PAC-Bayesian bound for the convergence rate of a Bayesian variant
  of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) that is an estimation method for the sparse additive
  model. Standard analyses for MKL require a strong condition on the design analogous
  to the restricted eigenvalue condition for the analysis of Lasso and Dantzig selector.
  In this paper, we apply PAC-Bayesian technique to show that the Bayesian variant
  of MKL achieves the optimal convergence rate without such strong conditions on the
  design. Basically our approach is a combination of PAC-Bayes and recently developed
  theories of non-parametric Gaussian process regressions. Our bound is developed
  in a fixed design situation. Our analysis includes the existing result of Gaussian
  process as a special case and the proof is much simpler by virtue of PAC-Bayesian
  technique. We also give the convergence rate of the Bayesian variant of Group Lasso
  as a finite dimensional special case.
