title: Learning Valuation Functions
abstract: A core element of microeconomics and game theory is that consumers have
  valuation functions over bundles of goods and that these valuations functions drive
  their purchases. A common assumption is that these functions are subadditive meaning
  that the value given to a bundle is at most the sum of values on the individual
  items. In this paper, we provide nearly tight guarantees on the efficient learnability
  of subadditive valuations. We also provide nearly tight bounds for the subclass
  of XOS (fractionally subadditive) valuations, also widely used in the literature.
  We additionally leverage the structure of valuations in a number of interesting
  subclasses and obtain algorithms with stronger learning guarantees.
