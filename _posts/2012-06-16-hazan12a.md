title: "(weak) Calibration is Computationally Hard"
abstract: We show that the existence of a computationally efficient calibration algorithm,
  with a low weak calibration rate, would imply the existence of an efficient algorithm
  for computing approximate Nash equilibria â€“ thus implying the unlikely conclusion
  that every problem in \emphPPAD is solvable in polynomial time.
