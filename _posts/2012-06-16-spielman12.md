title: Exact Recovery of Sparsely-Used Dictionaries
abstract: We consider the problem of learning sparsely used dictionaries with an arbitrary
  square dictionary and a random, sparse coefficient matrix. We prove that \emphO(n
  log \emphn) samples are sufficient to uniquely determine the coefficient matrix.
  Based on this proof, we design a polynomial-time algorithm, called Exact Recovery
  of Sparsely-Used Dictionaries (ER-SpUD), and prove that it probably recovers the
  dictionary and coefficient matrix when the coefficient matrix is sufficiently sparse.
  Simulation results show that ER-SpUD reveals the true dictionary as well as the
  coefficients with probability higher than many state-of-the-art algorithms.
