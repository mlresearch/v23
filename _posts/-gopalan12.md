title: Learning Functions of Halfspaces Using Prefix Covers
abstract: 'We present a simple query-algorithm for learning arbitrary functions of
  k halfspaces under any product distribution on the Boolean hypercube. Our algorithms
  learn any function of k halfspaces to within accuracy ε in time \emph{O((nk/ε)^{k+1})}
  under any product distribution on {0, 1}^{\emph{n}} using read-once branching programs
  as a hypothesis. This gives the first \emph{poly(n, 1/ε)} algorithm for learning
  even the intersection of 2 halfspaces under the uniform distribution on {0, 1}^{\emph{n}}
  previously known algorithms had an exponential dependence either on the accuracy
  parameter ε or the dimension \emph{n}. To prove this result, we identify a new structural
  property of Boolean functions that yields learnability with queries: that of having
  a small prefix cover.'
