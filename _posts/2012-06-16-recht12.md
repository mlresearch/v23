title: 'Toward a Noncommutative Arithmetic-geometric Mean Inequality: Conjectures,
  Case-studies, and Consequences'
abstract: Randomized algorithms that base iteration-level decisions on samples from
  some pool are ubiquitous in machine learning and optimization. Examples include
  stochastic gradient descent and randomized coordinate descent. This paper makes
  progress at theoretically evaluating the difference in performance between sampling
  with- and without-replacement in such algorithms. Focusing on least means squares
  optimization, we formulate a noncommutative arithmetic-geometric mean inequality
  that would prove that the expected convergence rate of without-replacement sampling
  is faster than that of with-replacement sampling. We demonstrate that this inequality
  holds for many classes of random matrices and for some pathological examples as
  well. We provide a deterministic worst-case bound on the gap between the discrepancy
  between the two sampling models, and explore some of the impediments to proving
  this inequality in full generality. We detail the consequences of this inequality
  for stochastic gradient descent and the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm for solving
  linear systems.
