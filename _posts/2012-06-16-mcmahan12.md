title: 'Open Problem: Better Bounds for Online Logistic Regression'
abstract: 'Known algorithms applied to online logistic regression on a feasible set
  of \emph{L}_{2} diameter \emph{D} achieve regret bounds like \emph{O}(\emph{e^{D}}
  log \emph{T}) in one dimension, but we show a bound of \emph{O}(âˆš\emph{D}  + log
  \emph{T}) is possible in a binary 1-dimensional problem. Thus, we pose the following
  question: Is it possible to achieve a regret bound for online logistic regression
  that is \emph{O}(poly(\emph{D}) log(\emph{T}))? Even if this is not possible in
  general, it would be interesting to have a bound that reduces to our bound in the
  one-dimensional case.'
