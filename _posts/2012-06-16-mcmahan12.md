title: 'Open Problem: Better Bounds for Online Logistic Regression'
abstract: 'Known algorithms applied to online logistic regression on a feasible set
  of \emphL_2 diameter \emphD achieve regret bounds like \emphO(\emphe^D log \emphT)
  in one dimension, but we show a bound of \emphO(âˆš\emphD  + log \emphT) is possible
  in a binary 1-dimensional problem. Thus, we pose the following question: Is it possible
  to achieve a regret bound for online logistic regression that is \emphO(poly(\emphD)
  log(\emphT))? Even if this is not possible in general, it would be interesting to
  have a bound that reduces to our bound in the one-dimensional case.'
