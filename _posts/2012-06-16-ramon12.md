title: 'Open Problem: Learning Dynamic Network Models from a Static Snapshot'
abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of learning a graph generating process
  given the evolving graph at a single point in time. Given a graph of sufficient
  size, can we learn the (repeatable) process that generated it? We formalize the
  generic problem and then consider two simple instances which are variations on the
  well-know graph generation models by Erdós-Rényi and Albert-Barabasi.
