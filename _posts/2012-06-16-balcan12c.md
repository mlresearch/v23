title: Robust Interactive Learning
abstract: In this paper we propose and study a generalization of the standard active-learning
  model where a more general type of queries including class conditional queries and
  mistake queries are allowed. Such queries have been quite useful in applications,
  but have been lacking theoretical understanding. In this work, we characterize the
  power of such queries under several well-known noise models. We give nearly tight
  upper and lower bounds on the number of queries needed to learn both for the general
  agnostic setting and for the bounded noise model. We further show that our methods
  can be made adaptive to the (unknown) noise rate, with only negligible loss in query
  complexity.
