title: Divergences and Risks for Multiclass Experiments
abstract: Csiszár's \emph{f}-divergence is a way to measure the similarity of two
  probability distributions. We study the extension of \emph{f}-divergence to more
  than two distributions to measure their joint similarity. By exploiting classical
  results from the comparison of experiments literature we prove the resulting divergence
  satisfies all the same properties as the traditional binary one. Considering the
  multidistribution case actually makes the proofs simpler. The key to these results
  is a formal bridge between these multidistribution \emph{f}-divergences and Bayes
  risks for multiclass classification problems.
