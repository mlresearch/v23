title: Unified Algorithms for Online Learning and Competitive Analysis
abstract: Online learning and competitive analysis are two widely studied frameworks
  for online decisionmaking settings. Despite the frequent similarity of the problems
  they study, there are significant differences in their assumptions, goals and techniques,
  hindering a unified analysis and richer interplay between the two. In this paper,
  we provide several contributions in this direction. We provide a single unified
  algorithm which by parameter tuning, interpolates between optimal regret for learning
  from experts (in online learning) and optimal competitive ratio for the metrical
  task systems problem (MTS) (in competitive analysis), improving on the results of
  Blum and Burch (1997). The algorithm also allows us to obtain new regret bounds
  against “drifting” experts, which might be of independent interest. Moreover, our
  approach allows us to go beyond experts/MTS, obtaining similar unifying results
  for structured action sets and “combinatorial experts", whenever the setting has
  a certain matroid structure.
