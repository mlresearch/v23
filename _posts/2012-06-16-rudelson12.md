title: Reconstruction from Anisotropic Random Measurements
abstract: Random matrices are widely used in sparse recovery problems, and the relevant
  properties of matrices with i.i.d. entries are well understood. The current paper
  discusses the recently introduced Restricted Eigenvalue (RE) condition, which is
  among the most general assumptions on the matrix, guaranteeing recovery. We prove
  a reduction principle showing that the RE condition can be guaranteed by checking
  the restricted isometry on a certain family of low-dimensional subspaces. This principle
  allows us to establish the RE condition for several broad classes of random matrices
  with dependent entries, including random matrices with subgaussian rows and non-trivial
  covariance structure, as well as matrices with independent rows, and uniformly bounded
  entries.
