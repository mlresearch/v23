title: Spectral Clustering of Graphs with General Degrees in the Extended Planted
  Partition Model
abstract: In this paper, we examine a spectral clustering algorithm for similarity
  graphs drawn from a simple random graph model, where nodes are allowed to have varying
  degrees, and we provide theoretical bounds on its performance. The random graph
  model we study is the Extended Planted Partition (EPP) model, a variant of the classical
  planted partition model. The standard approach to spectral clustering of graphs
  is to compute the bottom \emphk singular vectors or eigenvectors of a suitable graph
  Laplacian, project the nodes of the graph onto these vectors, and then use an iterative
  clustering algorithm on the projected nodes. However a challenge with applying this
  approach to graphs generated from the EPP model is that unnormalized Laplacians
  do not work, and normalized Laplacians do not concentrate well when the graph has
  a number of low degree nodes. We resolve this issue by introducing the notion of
  a degree-corrected graph Laplacian. For graphs with many low degree nodes, degree
  correction has a regularizing effect on the Laplacian. Our spectral clustering algorithm
  projects the nodes in the graph onto the bottom \emphk right singular vectors of
  the degree-corrected random-walk Laplacian, and clusters the nodes in this subspace.
  We show guarantees on the performance of this algorithm, demonstrating that it outputs
  the correct partition under a wide range of parameter values. Unlike some previous
  work, our algorithm does not require access to any generative parameters of the
  model.
