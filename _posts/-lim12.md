title: Autonomous Exploration For Navigating In MDPs
abstract: While intrinsically motivated learning agents hold considerable promise
  to overcome limitations of more supervised learning systems, quantitative evaluation
  and theoretical analysis of such agents are difficult. We propose to consider a
  restricted setting for autonomous learning where systematic evaluation of learning
  performance is possible. In this setting the agent needs to learn to navigate in
  a Markov Decision Process where extrinsic rewards are not present or are ignored.
  We present a learning algorithm for this scenario and evaluate it by the amount
  of exploration it uses to learn the environment.
