title: Kernels Based Tests with Non-asymptotic Bootstrap Approaches for Two-sample
  Problems
abstract: Considering either two independent i.i.d. samples, or two independent samples
  generated from a heteroscedastic regression model, or two independent Poisson processes,
  we address the question of testing equality of their respective distributions. We
  first propose single testing procedures based on a general symmetric kernel. The
  corresponding critical values are chosen from a wild or permutation bootstrap approach,
  and the obtained tests are exactly (and not just asymptotically) of level. We then
  introduce an aggregation method, which enables to overcome the difficulty of choosing
  a kernel and/or the parameters of the kernel. We derive non-asymptotic properties
  for the aggregated tests, proving that they may be optimal in a classical statistical
  sense.
