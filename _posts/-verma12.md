title: Distance Preserving Embeddings for General $n$-Dimensional Manifolds
abstract: Low dimensional embeddings of manifold data have gained popularity in the
  last decade. However, a systematic finite sample analysis of manifold embedding
  algorithms largely eludes researchers. Here we present two algorithms that, given
  access to just the samples, embed the underlying $n$- dimensional manifold into
  $R^d$ (where $d$ only depends on some key manifold properties such as its intrinsic
  dimension, volume and curvature) and \emph{guarantee} to approximately preserve
  all interpoint geodesic distances.
