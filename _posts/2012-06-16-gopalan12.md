title: Learning Functions of Halfspaces Using Prefix Covers
abstract: 'We present a simple query-algorithm for learning arbitrary functions of
  k halfspaces under any product distribution on the Boolean hypercube. Our algorithms
  learn any function of k halfspaces to within accuracy ε in time \emphO((nk/ε)^k+1)
  under any product distribution on 0, 1^\emphn using read-once branching programs
  as a hypothesis. This gives the first \emphpoly(n, 1/ε) algorithm for learning even
  the intersection of 2 halfspaces under the uniform distribution on 0, 1^\emphn previously
  known algorithms had an exponential dependence either on the accuracy parameter
  ε or the dimension \emphn. To prove this result, we identify a new structural property
  of Boolean functions that yields learnability with queries: that of having a small
  prefix cover.'
