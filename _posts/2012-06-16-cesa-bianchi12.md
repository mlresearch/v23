title: A Correlation Clustering Approach to Link Classification in Signed Networks
abstract: 'Motivated by social balance theory, we develop a theory of link classification
  in signed networks using the correlation clustering index as measure of label regularity.
  We derive learning bounds in terms of correlation clustering within three fundamental
  transductive learning settings: online, batch and active. Our main algorithmic contribution
  is in the active setting, where we introduce a new family of efficient link classifiers
  based on covering the input graph with small circuits. These are the first active
  algorithms for link classification with mistake bounds that hold for arbitrary signed
  networks.'
