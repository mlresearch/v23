title: Distance Preserving Embeddings for General $n$-Dimensional Manifolds
abstract: Low dimensional embeddings of manifold data have gained popularity in the
  last decade. However, a systematic finite sample analysis of manifold embedding
  algorithms largely eludes researchers. Here we present two algorithms that, given
  access to just the samples, embed the underlying n- dimensional manifold into R^d
  (where d only depends on some key manifold properties such as its intrinsic dimension,
  volume and curvature) and \emphguarantee to approximately preserve all interpoint
  geodesic distances.
