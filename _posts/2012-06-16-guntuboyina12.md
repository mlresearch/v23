title: L1 Covering Numbers for Uniformly Bounded Convex Functions
abstract: In this paper we study the covering numbers of the space of convex and uniformly
  bounded functions in multi-dimension. We find optimal upper and lower bounds for
  the ε-covering number \emph{M}(\emph{C}([\emph{a, b}]^{\emph{d}}, \emph{B}), ε,
  \emph{L}_{1}) in terms of the relevant constants, where \emph{d} > 1, \emph{a} <
  \emph{b} ∈ \emph{R}, \emph{B} > 0, and \emph{C}([\emph{a, b}]^{\emph{d}}, \emph{B})
  denotes the set of all convex functions on [\emph{a, b}]^{\emph{d}} that are uniformly
  bounded by \emph{B}. We summarize previously known results on covering numbers for
  convex functions and also provide alternate proofs of some known results. Our results
  have direct implications in the study of rates of convergence of empirical minimization
  procedures as well as optimal convergence rates in the numerous convexity constrained
  function estimation problems.
