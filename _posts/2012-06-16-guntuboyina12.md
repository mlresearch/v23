title: L1 Covering Numbers for Uniformly Bounded Convex Functions
abstract: In this paper we study the covering numbers of the space of convex and uniformly
  bounded functions in multi-dimension. We find optimal upper and lower bounds for
  the ε-covering number \emphM(\emphC([\empha, b]^\emphd, \emphB), ε, \emphL_1) in
  terms of the relevant constants, where \emphd > 1, \empha < \emphb ∈ \emphR, \emphB
  > 0, and \emphC([\empha, b]^\emphd, \emphB) denotes the set of all convex functions
  on [\empha, b]^\emphd that are uniformly bounded by \emphB. We summarize previously
  known results on covering numbers for convex functions and also provide alternate
  proofs of some known results. Our results have direct implications in the study
  of rates of convergence of empirical minimization procedures as well as optimal
  convergence rates in the numerous convexity constrained function estimation problems.
