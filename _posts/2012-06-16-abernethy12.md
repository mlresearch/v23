title: A Characterization of Scoring Rules for Linear Properties
abstract: We consider the design of proper scoring rules, equivalently proper losses,
  when the goal is to elicit some function, known as a property, of the underlying
  distribution. We provide a full characterization of the class of proper scoring
  rules when the property is linear as a function of the input distribution. A key
  conclusion is that any such scoring rule can be written in the form of a Bregman
  divergence for some convex function. We also apply our results to the design of
  prediction market mechanisms, showing a strong equivalence between scoring rules
  for linear properties and automated prediction market makers.
