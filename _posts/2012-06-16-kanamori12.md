title: A Conjugate Property between Loss Functions and Uncertainty Sets in Classification
  Problems
abstract: In binary classification problems, mainly two approaches have been proposed;
  one is loss function approach and the other is minimum distance approach. The loss
  function approach is applied to major learning algorithms such as support vector
  machine (SVM) and boosting methods. The loss function represents the penalty of
  the decision function on the training samples. In the learning algorithm, the empirical
  mean of the loss function is minimized to obtain the classifier. Against a backdrop
  of the development of mathematical programming, nowadays learning algorithms based
  on loss functions are widely applied to real-world data analysis. In addition, statistical
  properties of such learning algorithms are well-understood based on a lots of theoretical
  works. On the other hand, some learning methods such as Ï…-SVM, mini-max probability
  machine (MPM) can be formulated as minimum distance problems. In the minimum distance
  approach, firstly, the so-called uncertainty set is defined for each binary label
  based on the training samples. Then, the best separating hyperplane between the
  two uncertainty sets is employed as the decision function. This is regarded as an
  extension of the maximum-margin approach. The minimum distance approach is considered
  to be useful to construct the statistical models with an intuitive geometric interpretation,
  and the interpretation is helpful to develop the learning algorithms. However, the
  statistical properties of the minimum distance approach have not been intensively
  studied. In this paper, we consider the relation between the above two approaches.
  We point out that the uncertainty set in the minimum distance approach is described
  by using the level set of the conjugate of the loss function. Based on such relation,
  we study statistical properties of the minimum distance approach.
