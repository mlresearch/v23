title: 'The Best of Both Worlds: Stochastic and Adversarial Bandits'
abstract: We present a new bandit algorithm, SAO (Stochastic and Adversarial Optimal)
  whose regret is (essentially) optimal both for adversarial rewards and for stochastic
  rewards. Specifically, SAO combines the \emph{O}(√\emph{n}) worst-case regret of
  Exp3 (Auer et al., 2002b) and the (poly)logarithmic regret of UCB1 (Auer et al.,
  2002a) for stochastic rewards. Adversarial rewards and stochastic rewards are the
  two main settings in the literature on multi-armed bandits (MAB). Prior work on
  MAB treats them separately, and does not attempt to jointly optimize for both. This
  result falls into the general agenda to design algorithms that combine the optimal
  worst-case performance with improved guarantees for ``nice'' problem instances.
