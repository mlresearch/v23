title: Tight Bounds on Proper Equivalence Query Learning of DNF
abstract: We prove a new structural lemma for partial Boolean functions \emph{f},
  which we call the \emph{seed lemma} for \emph{DNF}. Using the lemma, we give the
  first subexponential algorithm for proper learning of poly(\emph{n})-term DNF in
  Angluin's Equivalence Query (EQ) model. The algorithm has time and query complexity
  2^{(Õ√\emph{n})}, which is optimal. We also give a new result on certificates for
  DNF-size, a simple algorithm for properly PAC-learning DNF, and new results on EQ-learning
  log \emph{n}-term DNF and decision trees.
