title: A Method of Moments for Mixture Models and Hidden Markov Models
abstract: Mixture models are a fundamental tool in applied statistics and machine
  learning for treating data taken from multiple subpopulations. The current practice
  for estimating the parameters of such models relies on local search heuristics (\emphe.g.,
  the EM algorithm) which are prone to failure, and existing consistent methods are
  unfavorable due to their high computational and sample complexity which typically
  scale exponentially with the number of mixture components. This work develops an
  efficient \emphmethod of moments approach to parameter estimation for a broad class
  of high-dimensional mixture models with many components, including multi-view mixtures
  of Gaussians (such as mixtures of axis-aligned Gaussians) and hidden Markov models.
  The new method leads to rigorous unsupervised learning results for mixture models
  that were not achieved by previous works; and, because of its simplicity, it offers
  a viable alternative to EM for practical deployment.
