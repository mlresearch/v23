title: Attribute-Efficient Learning andWeight-Degree Tradeoffs for Polynomial Threshold
  Functions
abstract: We study the challenging problem of learning decision lists attribute-efficiently,
  giving both positive and negative results. Our main positive result is a new tradeoff
  between the running time and mistake bound for learning length-\emph{k} decision
  lists over \emph{n} Boolean variables. When the allowed running time is relatively
  high, our new mistake bound improves significantly on the mistake bound of the best
  previous algorithm of Klivans and Servedio (Klivans and Servedio, 2006). Our main
  negative result is a new lower bound on the \emph{weight} of any degree-\emph{d}
  polynomial threshold function (PTF) that computes a particular decision list over
  \emph{k} variables (the ``ODD-MAX-BIT'' function). The main result of Beigel (Beigel,
  1994) is a weight lower bound of 2^{Ω(\emph{k}/\emph{d}^{2})}, which was shown to
  be essentially optimal for \emph{d} ≤ \emph{k}^{1/3} by Klivans and Servedio. Here
  we prove a 2^{Ω(√\emph{k/d})}  lower bound, which improves on Beigel's lower bound
  for \emph{d} > \emph{k}^{1/3}. This lower bound establishes strong limitations on
  the effectiveness of the Klivans and Servedio approach and suggests that it may
  be difficult to improve on our positive result. The main tool used in our lower
  bound is a new variant of Markov's classical inequality which may be of independent
  interest; it provides a bound on the derivative of a univariate polynomial in terms
  of both its degree \emph{and} the size of its coefficients.
