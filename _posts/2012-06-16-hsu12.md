title: Random Design Analysis of Ridge Regression
abstract: This work gives a simultaneous analysis of both the ordinary least squares
  estimator and the ridge regression estimator in the random design setting under
  mild assumptions on the covariate/response distributions. In particular, the analysis
  provides sharp results on the “out-of-sample” prediction error, as opposed to the
  “in-sample” (fixed design) error. The analysis also reveals the effect of errors
  in the estimated covariance structure, as well as the effect of modeling errors;
  neither of which effects are present in the fixed design setting. The proof of the
  main results are based on a simple decomposition lemma combined with concentration
  inequalities for random vectors and matrices.
