title: Random Design Analysis of Ridge Regression
abstract: This work gives a simultaneous analysis of both the ordinary least squares
  estimator and the ridge regression estimator in the random design setting under
  mild assumptions on the covariate/response distributions. In particular, the analysis
  provides sharp results on the ``out-of-sample'' prediction error, as opposed to
  the ``in-sample'' (fixed design) error. The analysis also reveals the effect of
  errors in the estimated covariance structure, as well as the effect of modeling
  errors; neither of which effects are present in the fixed design setting. The proof
  of the main results are based on a simple decomposition lemma combined with concentration
  inequalities for random vectors and matrices.
